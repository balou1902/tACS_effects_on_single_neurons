# tACS_effects_on_single_neurons

This folder contains the codes used in the paper Tran et al., 2020. Effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation on spiking activity in computational models of single neocortical neurons. In this paper, we investigated the effects of tACS amplitudes on computational models of single neocortical neurons.

## Information about the data
Due to the high size of data, not all of them will be in that depository. Several sets will be available and 




/ subfolders in order to investigate the tacs on different types of cells 



## Softwares requirements

Matlab, NEURON
gmsh (optional)


Refer to the following article for more details: Tran et al., 2020. Effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation on spiking activity in computational models of single neocortical neurons.
